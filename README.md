# Personal_Site

## Purpose of Project

I was thinking of ways to promote myself and get my name out there, and it dawned on me that having a personal website would be a great idea. It would not only give me more practice, but I could try my hand at some different technologies. I am glad I took this initiative because I learned a lot on this project, from how to make your website responsive for all screen types, styling appropriately for said screen types, and learning some new frameworks and libraries.

## Implementation

My site is driven with **Node.js** for the backend, with **Express** handling the minimal routing I have set up. For the styling and responsiveness of the site, I wanted to learn **Tailwind CSS** as another tool to add to my arsenal. As I have done only some minimal styling for websites, I like Tailwind's functionality and ease of use. Not only did I learn how to use Tailwind, but I got a deeper understanding of **CSS** styling principles overall.

In addition, I thought it would be an excellent idea to have a chart of some kind that would be able to showcase my skills. A more presentational approach, rather than having them listed out. (I have them bullet-pointed on mobile due to the illegible graph on small screen sizes.) That is where **Chart.js** comes into play. Chart.js is a powerful javascript library where you can create many charts and graphs, which also allows customization in numerous ways. I will utilize this library in the future if any project needs data to be showcased.
